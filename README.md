# MERN Stack Workout App

Welcome to the MERN Stack Workout App repository! This project is a recreation of the popular MERN Stack Tutorial series by Net Ninja, featuring a workout app. In this version, the original app has been reimagined using TypeScript and Redux for state management.

## Overview

This workout app is built using the MERN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. TypeScript has been incorporated for static typing, ensuring a more robust codebase. Redux, a powerful state management library, has been integrated to manage the application's state efficiently.


## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data and workout information.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for building robust APIs and handling requests.
- **React**: Frontend library for creating dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript with static types for enhanced code reliability.
- **Redux**: State management library for predictable state containers.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.
